Using the EduBase-V2 board with the TM4C123GH6PM attached, we are able to create a basic Arithmetic Calcualtor with no bugs. Along with the microcontroller, the EduBase-V2 comes with an 16x2 LCD display, 4x4 Keypad, and Magnetic Buzzer along with other components. The software used is the Keil uVision5 written in C.

For this project, we will be using the 4x4 keypad, Magnetic Buzzer, LED, and the 16x2 LCD display. After initilizing all of the parts mentioned, we need to prepare the the 4x4 to take the input from the user. After referring to the datasheet, we were able to create a user function to return a char depending on what the user pressed on the keypad
